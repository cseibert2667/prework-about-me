      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>A couple years ago, I started messing around with Codecademy in my free time and found I was actually having fun while learning. I've always liked creating and building things, and I've been fascinated with computer programs & video games since I was very little... and coding is a great combination of the two! As stated above, I've been in tech support for nearly 4 years and have always excelled at it, but I want to dive deeper and learn how to build the programs that make all this technology actually function. </p>
